Script will scrape the songs in a given playlist and determine the "vibe."
Then given a certain track, it will determine how closley the "vibe" of the song will match the playlist.
It asks the user what they think after listening and will update the "vibe" based on the user's answer.

Currently the playlist URI and code is hard-coded.
My spotify username is also hardcoded.
Track URI can be retrieved through spotify's website.
