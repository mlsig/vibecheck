# Vibecheck
Project for NJIT CS370 Fall 2019

To Install Spotipy: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation

Run using python 3 in terminal

Script will scrape the songs in a given playlist and determine the "vibe."
Then given a certain track, it will determine how closley the "vibe" of the song will match the playlist.
It asks the user what they think after listening and will update the "vibe" based on the user's answer.

Currently the Playlist URI and code is hard-coded.
My spotify username is also hardcoded. I made it when I was 12 so please don't judge

At some point I will make them input variables when you run the application.

Track URI can be retrieved through Spotify's website.
